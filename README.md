# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a simple and fun two-player game where players take turns marking Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their symbols in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—wins the game. If all nine cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
